<h2>While Statement</h2>
<p>While loop: In a while loop, the condition is checked before the code within<br>
   the loop is executed. If the condition is false at the start, the code within the<br>
   loop will not run at all.</p>

<script>
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
 	 i++;
}
</script>

<h2>Do While Statement</h2>
<p>  Do-While loop: In a do-while loop, the code within the loop is executed first,<br>
     and the condition is checked afterwards. This means the code within the loop will<br>
     always run at least once, even if the condition is false at the start.</p>

<script>
    var i = 0;
    do {
          console.log(i);
      i++;
    } while (i < 5);
    </script>
